## Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs

object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}

key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}

key = x/y/z

value = a


## Solution:

How do you run JavaScript script through the Terminal?

You can Run your JavaScript File from your Terminal only if you have installed NodeJs runtime. 
If you have Installed it then Simply open the terminal and type “node FileName.js”. 
If you don’t have NodeJs runtime environment then go to NodeJs Runtime Environment Download and Download it.

Steps: ##1

1. Clone the repo from GITHUB with below command 
	git clone 
2. Open Terminal or Command Prompt.
3. Set Path to where File is Located (using cd).
4. Type “node New.js” and Click Enter


Steps: ##2 (If you want to quickly test the function in an online javascript compiler)
1. Copy the content of the file ObjectKeyFunc.js 
2. Open https://onecompiler.com/javascript in different tab.
3. Clear the console and paste the content here.
4. Click on Run button to get the output.
5. Change the obj, Key value as per requiremnet.
